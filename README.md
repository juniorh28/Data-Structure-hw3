This is a binary search tree called MovieBST
Movie Node

Will create a BST with the middle movieId as the root
each movie node will be check if larger or smaller than the root 

For testing purposes I limited the file to read up to 29 lines.

Need to edit:
  Must pass the genres (String[]) to the constructor.
